In one case, they learned it would take six years to build a needed rail link. Others lacked access to clean power - crucial for a project for \"green\" electric vehicles. Some did not offer enough nearby skilled labor. \"We were hitting a deadline,\" said Scott Keogh, Scout's CEO, so they settled for a parcel in South Carolina that has all their desired features but is a bit smaller than they initially wanted - 1,600 instead of 2,000 acres.\r\n\r\nScout's scramble highlights a challenge facing dozens of global manufacturers. Fueled by a combination of hefty government incentives, a transition to new transportation and energy technologies, and national security concerns about relying on distant suppliers, especially in China, there's a factory-building boom taking place across the U.S.\r\n\r\nBut all that new construction has a real estate problem. More specifically, a \"megasite\" problem. While the U.S. has plentiful land, there are not that many places to quickly plunk a billion-dollar-plus factory. The factory renaissance could soon hit a barrier because of the scarcity of ready-to-go megasites, according to 25 economic development groups, state and local officials, utilities, and companies interviewed by Reuters.\r\n\r\nThat would be a problem for the Biden administration, which has pushed through legislation to fuel the developments. Corporations have announced dozens of projects since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act last year.\r\n\r\nA White House official said it was a \"high-class problem\" to have, adding: \"Folks are finding places to build. I don't think I've heard of one company abandoning plans to go forward because they're not able to find a site.\" There’s no single definition for a megasite, but it generally refers to a very large plot — one common threshold is 1,000 acres — tied to transport, low-cost and preferably renewable energy, and a nearby supply of skilled labor. Local economic development agencies and states have long cultivated big industrial developments by assembling land and installing utilities in the hope of luring the next big auto assembly or steel plant with the promise of fast-track building.\r\n\r\nSpeed is often key. When electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive Inc. was hunting for a place to build a $5 billion plant, it considered a spot just outside Fort Worth, Texas.\r\n\r\nBut the EV-maker \"had some pretty aggressive timelines as far as when they needed certain elements of the transportation infrastructure in place,\" said Robert Sturns, director of the Fort Worth Economic Development Department. Fort Worth could not meet those, and the project jumped to Georgia in late 2021.\r\n\r\nThe requirements on megasites can be very specific. Intel Corp's $20 billion semiconductor plant going up in Ohio could not be situated too close to a rail line, since passing trains can create unacceptable vibrations, according to the company.\r\n\r\nEven smaller factories can find it difficult to build quickly in this environment.\r\n\r\nCubicPV, which makes silicon wafers used in solar panels, launched a nationwide search for a 100-to-130-acre site immediately after the IRA passed last August. They have a tight time frame, said Todd Templeton, the company's chief commercial officer, since IRA tax incentives start to phase out at the end of this decade.\r\n\r\nThey studied hundreds of sites but constantly hit roadblocks. Some locations said it would take two or three years just to get utilities installed, said Templeton. They are choosing from two good possibilities and are aiming to have the plant open by 2025.\r\n\r\nOne site selection executive, Gregg Wassmansdorf, a senior managing director of global strategy consulting with Newmark Group Inc., estimates fewer than two dozen true megasites are still available across the country at widely varying stages of development.\r\n\r\n\"Every company, of course, wants shovel-ready megasites,\" said Christopher Chung, chief executive of the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina. \"But those are more or less pretty picked over with a couple of exceptions here or there.\" Didi Caldwell, president of consultancy firm Global Location Strategies in Greenville, South Carolina, uses a database from fDi Markets, a London-based firm that tracks major cross-border investments worldwide, to gauge how fast demand for megasites has grown in the U.S.\r\n\r\nAccording to that source, she said, there were 20 industrial projects with investments over $1 billion and a promise of creating at least 1,000 jobs announced last year in the U.S. - up from 15 the year before, and only eight the year before that.\r\n\r\nIn the decade and a half before the recent spike, the annual average was just over five and many years saw just three or four large projects announced.\r\n\r\nOne major constraint, particularly for energy-hungry factories such as battery plants, is the need for large amounts of electrical power.\r\n\r\n\"Some of these projects require hundreds of megawatts,\" said Caldwell. \"At the same time, we're shutting a lot of coal plants.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the U.S. is investing heavily in building green power sources, those projects also face delays. A report by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that a typical project built in 2022 took five years from the initial request to interconnect it with the electrical grid to commercial operations, up from three years in 2015.\r\n\r\nThe cost and difficulty of building new long-distance transmission lines has also soared in recent years, said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies LLC, an engineering and economic analysis firm focused on the power industry.\r\n\r\nThere's a rush to prepare more megasites. Michigan just created four. The governors of South Carolina, Virginia and North Carolina have each proposed to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on readying industrial sites in the coming years. Illinois this year will allocate $40 million in grants to prepare existing sites for companies seeking to move quickly.\r\n\r\nBut creating new megasites is inherently difficult. Environmental regulations often limit developments, local communities sometimes oppose them, and the sheer scale of the projects often require just the right mix of conditions to make it feasible.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, companies want more megasites for pocketbook reasons.\r\n\r\n\"The reason they would like more megasites, of course, is that then they could compete for better pricing\" when they have more options to choose from, said Mike Tracy, principal of the Agile Group, which advises companies like automakers.\r\n\r\nThere are also the intangibles.\r\n\r\nThe VW Scout plant, for instance, is situated in clear view of a major interstate highway connecting South Carolina's coastal regions to the upper Midwest. That means putting the Scout name, being revived by VW after four decades of dormancy, in sight of tens of thousands of passing motorists a day.\r\n\r\n\"We have a lot of people who are coming from the north or from the Midwest down that highway that would drive right by that facility as they go to the beaches of South Carolina and Georgia and Florida,\" said Harry Lightsey III, South Carolina’s secretary of commerce. \"That was all important.\" ", new DateTime(2022, 9, 26, 0, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Unspecified), true, 2m, 800, "U.S. President Joe Biden attends the groundbreaking of the new Intel semiconductor manufacturing facility in New Albany, Ohio, U.S., September 9, 2022.

As it looks to the future, FTX is negotiating with stakeholders about options for restarting its crypto exchange, and it may make a decision on that in the current quarter, Dietderich said.\r\n\r\nHe offered few details on what a reboot might mean for FTX customers whose crypto deposits have been locked up during the bankruptcy case.\r\n\r\nSo far, FTX customers in Japan have been the only ones able to withdraw any funds so far, because of that country's relatively strong crypto regulations, Dietderich said.\r\n\r\nFTX would need significant capital to restart its crypto exchange, because the existing customer interface had little connection to the movement of money behind the scenes, the lawyer said.\r\n\r\n\"The app worked beautifully, but in truth it was a facade,\" Dietderich said.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear whether FTX should use its own funds to re-start the exchange, rather than using the money to repay customers, Dietderich said. Restarting the exchange might require outside funding or a sale of the exchange's assets. FTX is also working on a preliminary Chapter 11 plan that would offer the company a path out of bankruptcy, Dietderich said.\r\n\r\nFTX intends to file that plan by July, but it acknowledged that many details would have to be worked out as creditors fight for their share of the company's assets.

Even though some policymakers wobbled about further hikes at the March meeting, due largely to the month's banking stress, and some talked of 'mild recession' ahead, minutes of the meeting suggest there was enough confidence about containing last month's bank blowup to nudge rates above 5%.\r\n\r\nTaking in all the information, futures markets still show a near 75% chance of another quarter point rate rise to the 5.0-5.25% range in May, but more than 60 basis points of cuts from there to yearend.\r\n\r\nTwo-year Treasury yields were stuck at 4%, with producer price inflation and weekly jobless up next on Thursday's data calendar. Wall St stock futures were back in positive territory.

So who better to ask for personal finance advice than a couple of the most powerful chatbots on the planet?\r\n\r\nBoth OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard are dominating headlines recently, for their generative capabilities and vast storehouses of information. Each has far more processing power than, say, any individual personal finance writer (ahem). That in mind, we asked our AI assistants-slash-overlords these classic personal finance questions:\r\n\r\nWhat is one great business idea?\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurs are always looking for the Next Big Thing. On this matter, ChatGPT was surprisingly specific: \"One idea could be to start a subscription-based meal delivery service that caters to customers with specific dietary needs or preferences, such as vegan, gluten-free, or low-carb diets.\" Bard does not seem to like limiting itself to one option, even when asked to do so – it prefers lists. It threw out a whole slew of ideas, including dog walking, translation, “website flipping\" and even working as a virtual assistant.\r\n\r\nWhat one town should I move to, to save the most money?\r\n\r\nWith the rise of remote work in the pandemic era, many Americans have considered relocating to lower-cost locales. ChatGPT singled out Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Knoxville, Tennessee, praising both for their affordability and growing job markets.\r\n\r\nBard also likes Fort Wayne, but added a few other contenders: Henderson, Nevada; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Wichita, Kansas; and Oklahoma City.\r\n\r\nWhat one dividend stock is the most attractively valued?\r\n\r\nWhile stressing that as an AI language processor it “cannot provide personalized investment advice or predict stock performance,” ChatGPT praised telecommunications giant AT&T (T.N) for its cheap metrics. Its lower-than-average price-to-earnings ratio, plus its 7.1% dividend yield, caught the chatbot’s attention. Meanwhile, chatty Bard concurred with the choice of AT&T, but also added Verizon (VZ.N), Procter & Gamble (PG.N), 3M (MMM.N), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) to the mix as bargain stocks.\r\n\r\nWhat one growth stock is the most attractively valued?\r\n\r\nWhen ChatGPT crunched the numbers on this question, it produced a familiar name: Amazon (AMZN.O), praising the e-commerce giant for its attractive price-to-sales and price-to-book metrics after a challenging year.\r\n\r\nBard also mentioned Amazon, but tossed in Apple (AAPL.O), Tesla (TSLA.O), and (maybe not surprisingly) Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O), noting that price-to-earnings ratios for all of them were well below their five-year averages.\r\n\r\nGive me one idea of a growing career field?\r\n\r\nMany Americans seem to be switching careers these days – either of their own volition with the Great Resignation or forced because of layoffs. ChatGPT tells me to consider the field of data science and analytics, specifically roles like data analyst and machine learning engineer.\r\n\r\nBard is a little broader in its suggestions, nudging me to consider becoming a nurse practitioner, software developer, social media manager or even solar photovoltaic installer.\r\n\r\nWhat colleges give the most bang for the buck?\r\n\r\nSince my own teenager is off to college in the fall, I was particularly curious about this one. And ChatGPT did indeed have some answers: The University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.\r\n\r\nBard had its own thoughts, though. It singled out the University of Washington, CUNY Brooklyn, Purdue, the University of Florida in Gainesville and Oklahoma State as offering an attractive combination of quality and value.\r\n\r\nWhat one vacation spot is the cheapest option for summer?\r\n\r\nBard was not very helpful here, suggesting bunking with friends or family or arranging a \"staycation,\" which was hardly inspiring. But ChatGPT did have specific ideas for an affordable summer trip: Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and Austin, Texas.\r\n\r\nCan money buy happiness?\r\n\r\nI couldn’t leave our new AI friends without asking a deeper question about money and its role in our existence. ChatGPT admitted it can be a factor in a happy life: “Studies have shown that up to a certain point, increasing wealth can be associated with increased happiness, as it can provide access to basic needs such as food, shelter, and healthcare, as well as opportunities for education and experiences.”\r\n\r\nBut Bard was a little more declarative on the subject, that cash will not get us the ultimate satisfaction we are seeking.\r\n\r\n“Money cannot buy you happiness itself,” it told me. “Happiness is a state of mind that comes from within.

The payment to porn star Stormy Daniels was part of a wider \"catch-and-kill\" scheme to suppress damaging news stories about Trump, prosecutors said. Prosecutors will need to go through a two-step process of proving that Trump intended to not only falsify business records but did so in furtherance of another crime.\r\n\r\n\"There's actually two levels of intent that have to be proven,\" said Anna Cominsky, a professor at New York Law School. \"First, they have to prove an intent to defraud by making a false business record. Then they have to prove an intent to defraud, including an intent to commit or conceal another crime.\"\r\n\r\nFalsification of business records on its own is a misdemeanor under New York law, but prosecutors elevated the charges to felonies by alleging they were tied to other crimes. The 34-count indictment does not list the other crimes, but Bragg told reporters Trump falsified records as part of a scheme to violate state and federal election laws, as well as state tax laws. Trump's lawyers have denied he falsified any records. They may also argue Trump's intent in paying Daniels was not to help his presidential campaign but to quash an unflattering story, which is not illegal.\r\n\r\nThe case marks the first time a former president has been criminally charged, and Trump's ongoing campaign to retake the presidency in 2024 has heaped additional scrutiny onto the case. Trump and his Republican allies claim the prosecution is politically motivated.\r\n\r\nTrump pleaded not guilty to the charges and denies having an affair with Daniels. His lawyers have said there were no false records entered into the Trump Organization's books, and that they will seek to get the charges dismissed before the case reaches trial.\r\n\r\nProving a defendant intended to commit a crime is a common challenge for prosecutors in white collar cases. Often, they use contemporaneous emails and text messages to show the defendant knew what they were doing was illegal. They also often rely on testimony from witnesses involved in or close to the scheme.\r\n\r\nBragg told reporters that electronic communication records backed up the case, although Trump himself has been widely reported not to have used text messages or emails until recently. A statement of facts accompanying the indictment cites meetings and phone calls with Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer, indicating his testimony will be central to proving Trump's intent. Cohen, who testified twice before the grand jury, has said Trump directed him to make and disguise the payments. But he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and violating election law with the Daniels payment. Trump's lawyers will use this to attack his credibility.\r\n\r\n\"You have to prove that Trump himself did that or caused that to be done. So you're going to have to believe the witnesses' accounts,\" said Sarah Krissoff, a former federal prosecutor and partner at Day Pitney. \"Here, they have some narrators, but the narrators have a lot of baggage.\"\r\n\r\nCohen said in a text message that the \"ongoing and continuous attacks\" on his credibility would have little impact on the case.\r\n\r\nProsecutors' statement of facts provides some hints as to how they might back up Cohen's testimony. It describes a meeting in Trump Tower shortly after Trump launched his presidential campaign in 2015 in which Trump, Cohen, and the chief executive of American Media Inc (AMI) discussed a plan to suppress negative news stories.\r\n\r\nDaniels in October 2016 sought to sell her story about her sexual encounter with Trump to AMI, which owns the National Enquirer tabloid. AMI then alerted Cohen, who negotiated the hush money deal with Daniels' lawyer.\r\n\r\nAMI's CEO, David Pecker, also appeared before the grand jury that indicted Trump. If he testifies at trial and corroborates Cohen's account, it could help prosecutors' case.\r\n\r\nThe statement of facts also references former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg, who pleaded guilty to tax fraud and other crimes last year and testified against the Trump Organization, which was convicted of orchestrating a 15-year tax fraud scheme.\r\n\r\nWhile it is unclear if Weisselberg would turn on Trump, his testimony could help prosecutors corroborate their evidence.\r\n\r\nCohen and a lawyer for Pecker did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.\r\n\r\nProsecutors have the burden of proof, and Trump does not need to offer his own explanation of the payments to prevail.

The firm had previously said in March that it was accelerating Hakki's transition to replace outgoing senior partner David Beveridge.\r\n\r\nShearman is one of several big law firms to lay off employees since late last year. The firm in February cut 12 associates and 26 business services professionals in the United States, citing a need to \"align our capacity levels with existing client demands.\"\r\n\r\nLast week, technology-focused law firm Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian laid off 10% of attorneys, paralegals and staff in its U.S. offices. The firm, like several others that have let go of lawyers and staff, attributed the move to macroeconomic and market conditions.

Bradley (1-0) allowed three runs and five hits while whiffing eight and walking one.

Minter, who blew the save in the first game of the series, pitched a perfect ninth and picked up his second save.\r\n\r\nNeither starting pitcher factored into the decision. Cincinnati's Hunter Greene worked six innings and allowed three runs on seven hits to go along with a season-high 10 strikeouts.

He got a no-decision but pitched well, giving up two runs and five hits in five innings. He struck out four and did not walk a batter while throwing 69 pitches.\r\n\r\nAfter the Nationals took a 2-1 lead in the top of the fourth, the Angels loaded the bases with no outs in the bottom of the inning. Washington starter MacKenzie Gore nearly escaped, striking out Gio Urshela and O'Hoppe. But Brett Phillips followed with a walk, driving in a run and tying the game at 2-2.\r\n\r\nRoyals 10, Rangers 1\r\n\r\nMJ Melendez drove in three runs, Bobby Witt Jr. recorded his first three-hit night of the season and Kansas City snapped a three-game losing streak with a victory in Arlington, Texas.\r\n\r\nKansas City starter Brad Keller (2-1) impressed, limiting Texas to just one run on three hits with seven strikeouts and one walk over 6 2/3 innings. The only blemish on the night for Keller was giving up a solo homer to Nathaniel Lowe in the first inning.\r\n\r\nAfter that, KC controlled the game. The Royals scored three runs in the second inning to take a 3-1 lead, the last two coming on a two-run double by Melendez off Rangers starter Nathan Eovaldi. Eovaldi (1-2) allowed six runs on 10 hits with no walks and seven strikeouts over five innings. Rangers reliever Taylor Hearn gave up four runs in the seventh.\r\n\r\nA's 8, Orioles 4\r\n\r\nCarlos Perez had three hits, including a home run, and Oakland ended a six-game losing streak with a win at Baltimore.\r\n\r\nBrent Rooker homered, singled and had three RBIs for Oakland, which plated eight runs for the second straight game. Chad Smith (1-0) pitched two scoreless innings of relief for the win.\r\n\r\nRooker and Jace Peterson opened the Oakland eighth with singles off Keegan Akin (0-1). Cionel Perez replaced Akin and Aledmys Diaz loaded the bases with a bunt single. Jesus Aguilar's sacrifice fly put the A's ahead 5-4, and Oakland scored runs on a safety squeeze and Perez's RBI single to take control for good.
